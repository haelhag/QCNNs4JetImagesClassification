# QCNNs4JetImagesClassification

Motivated by the problem of complex top-quark jet images produced as a result of hypothesized BSM particles, this project aims to utilize QML model represented in QCNNs hoping to gain better classification accuracy between the top-quark jet signal and its corresponding QCD background. QCNN architecture was introduced by Cong et al. 2020 and utuilized in various classification tasks in other works showing promising results. 
The coding framework was taken from: https://github.com/ML4SCI/QML-hands-on/blob/main/notebooks/4_QCNN_MNIST.ipynb, and further modified to match the problem at hand.
